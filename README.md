# Background Context
This is a Test Driven Development (TDD) Sandbox Project created as part of the TDD training provided by [Valentina JemuoviÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentinajemuovic) through the [Optivem Journal](https://journal.optivem.com/). The aim is to safely practice applying TDD to a legacy code project. This involves setting up an automated build pipeline and then retroactively adding in automated tests following TDD.

# Use Cases: 
1. Employee books a desk.

As an employee I must be able to book a desk for a specific date and receive an email confirming the booking.
- The Employee must be able to log in using their email address and generated password.
- After logging in, the Employee must see the current day's desk bookings.
- The Employee must be able to choose a date.
- Once the date is chosen the Employee must be able to see available desks.
- The Employee must be able to select an available desk and book it.
- Then once the booking has been confirmed the Employee must receive a confirmation email with the booking details.
2. Employee views desk booking history.

As an Employee I must be able to view a history of desks that I have booked.The Employee must be able to sign in using their email address.
- After logging in the Employee must be able to see a list of all desks they have booked and the booking details (booking date/desk).
3. Employee cancels desk booking.

As an Employee I must be able to cancel a desk booking.
- The Employee must be able to log in using their email address.
- After signing in the Employee must be able to see a list of all desks they have booked and the booking details (date/desk).
- The Employee must then be able to select current and future bookings.
- The Employee must then be able to cancel that booking ~by adding their confirmation number for that booking~.
- Then once a booking has been canceled the Employee should receive a confirmation email with the cancelled bookings details.
4. Employee views current desk availability.

As an Employee I must be able to see what desks are currently available.
- The Employee must be able to log in using their email address.
- After signing in, the Employee must see the current day's desk bookings.
- The Employee must be able to choose a date/time.
- Once the date is chosen the Employee must be able to see available desks.

# External systems
1. Email sending service - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). e2e, UAT and production environments use sendgrid test plan credentials. Host and API key are set via the following backend environment variables: 
- `SENDGRID_HOST` - default value is `api.sendgrid.com`
- `SENDGRID_KEY` - needs to be provided
2. System clock - saving timestamps (e.g. booking created time)
